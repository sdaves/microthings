<h1>IV. Backing Services</h1>
<h2 id="treat-backing-services-as-attached-resources">Treat backing services as attached resources</h2><p>A <em>backing service</em> is any service the app consumes over the network as part of its normal operation. Examples include datastores (such as MySQL or CouchDB), messaging/queueing systems (such as RabbitMQ or Beanstalkd), SMTP services for outbound email (such as Postfix), and caching systems (such as Memcached).</p><p>Backing services like the database are traditionally managed by the same systems administrators as the app's runtime deploy. In addition to these locally-managed services, the app may also have services provided and managed by third parties. Examples include SMTP services (such as Postmark), metrics-gathering services (such as New Relic or Loggly), binary asset services (such as Amazon S3), and even API-accessible consumer services (such as Twitter, Google Maps, or Last.fm).</p><p><strong>The code for a twelve-factor app makes no distinction between local and third party services.</strong> To the app, both are attached resources, accessed via a URL or other locator/credentials stored in the config. A deploy of the twelve-factor app should be able to swap out a local MySQL database with one managed by a third party (such as Amazon RDS) without any changes to the app's code. Likewise, a local SMTP server could be swapped with a third-party SMTP service (such as Postmark) without code changes. In both cases, only the resource handle in the config needs to change.</p><p>Each distinct backing service is a <em>resource</em>. For example, a MySQL database is a resource; two MySQL databases (used for sharding at the application layer) qualify as two distinct resources. The twelve-factor app treats these databases as <em>attached resources</em>, which indicates their loose coupling to the deploy they are attached to.</p><p>Resources can be attached and detached to deploys at will. For example, if the app's database is misbehaving due to a hardware issue, the app's administrator might spin up a new database server restored from a recent backup. The current production database could be detached, and the new database attached -- all without any code changes.</p>
